# SPOILER ALERT

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.

1. Peppermint Forest Challenge : Guess a number between 1 and 10,000. If the number is odd, player may take a candy cane and proceed. If the number is even, player continues without a candy cane. Note there is no serious consequence, just a light challenge. Goal: Flavorful stop, minimal risk.
2. Nana's Nuthouse Challenge: Select a magic number. If the number is odd, player unlocks the chocolate bridge and advances to the Licorice Lagoon. If the number is even, player breaks the chocolate bridge and must answer a random trivia question. The trivia question just requires player input; there is no right or wrong answer to advance. Goal: Successfully cross to reach Licorice Lagoon.
3. Licorice Lagoon Challenge: Guess a number challenge, from 2000 - 5000 how many licorice make up the lagoon. If the player inputs an odd number, they proceed directly to Lollipop Castle.

If the trivia question response is incorrect, the player will take the long path to Lollipop Castle. Goal: Earn the key to Lollipop Castle.
4.  Lollipop Castle Challenge: Requirement: You must have the key from Licorice Lagoon to enter. The challenge is to choose a jumping number. If the player chooses one of the correct numbers between 200 and 400, the player succeeds, survives, and is teleported to Frosted Palace. If the player does not choose the correct number, they fail the challenge and will have to take the long way to the Frosted Palace. Goal: Earn the key to Frosted Palace by attempting the challenge.
5. Frosted Palace Challenge: Requirement: Must have the key from Lollipop Castle to enter. The challenge is the guessing game in the cold. The player must guess a number between 1 and 10. The player's temperature drops as they guess the incorrect number. If the player guesses the number correctly, on the first try, they are teleported directly to Queen Kandy's Castle. If the player guesses correctly later, they get the kep but must take the long way to Queen Kandy's Castle. If the temperature drops to 0°F the player freezes to death.
