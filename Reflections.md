## Milka: 

The overall approach for this project was to build a fun computer version of the candy land board game. In this project we implemented various things to make its functionality a very smooth one. We divided each special location in our game by functionality. I learned how to make a functional map in this case using arrays. At first we had planned to use graphics to create a spin wheel but we couldn't make it due to the time factor. If we had more time we would definitely implement that. If I could go back in time and give my past self some advice about this project I would definitely advise her to experiment with different ways of doing this as in the world of programming there are so many ways to approach the same problem. This project wouldn't be the same without my teammates. We all worked really hard to make this project successful. There were ups and downs as well as some rocks along the road but we managed to make this project come into life. I really enjoyed my time with this project and my teammates. I learned something from every single one of them.

The final project would not have been possible without the hard work, dedication, bright ideas, and diversity of thought and experiences each group member put forth. Our overall approach to this project was dividing tasks and using a time sensitive approach to them. There were moments of high-stress and conflict resolution, and we got through. With unlimited time, I would like to create more complex challenges in PathPlaces. I learned so much about myself as a coder; namely my growth from the beginning of the semester. I learned the structure and necessary parts of a code and proper implementation of parent and subclasses. 


## Tabitha:
For this project, we broke the work into manageable milestones—designing the classes first, implementing each challenge individually, and finally integrating everything through the main method. This structure helped keep us organized and allowed us to make steady progress.
 I personally learned how to apply object-oriented design principles more effectively, especially using inheritance. 
Early on, we thought about using cards instead of a spinning wheel—or even using both—but ultimately stuck with the wheel for simplicity. With more time, I would’ve loved to add richer storytelling, a graphical user interface, or a leaderboard system to increase engagement. 

One of the most helpful pieces of feedback we received was a suggestion to include stronger consequences for incorrect guesses, which inspired the freezing mechanic in Frosted Palace. 

We divided the work by classes and communicated frequently, which really helped. Each of us took ownership of different sections of the game, but we regularly tested and reviewed each other’s contributions to ensure consistency. While there were definitely some bumps along the way, I’m proud of the collaboration and how we saw the project through to the end.I am grateful for all that I learned from my teammates throughout the duration of this project.
